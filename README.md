# Tarefa-3.1b

The aim of this work is to develop skills in creating wireframes, mockups and prototypes. To this end, I was asked to add two new views to the Animalec project that comes as an example in the book "Desenvolvimento Web Avançadot"(1) .

## Wireframe and Mockups

The work was divided into several tasks, two of which were the creation of a wireframe and a mockup. The work carried out can be consulted via the pdf's in the `Wireframe_Mockups` folder or via the links below.

## Prototype HTML and CSS version
Following on from the Wireframe and Mockup, the prototype was developed in html and css. The aim of this prototype is to provide a visualization of what the project will look like via the browser.
